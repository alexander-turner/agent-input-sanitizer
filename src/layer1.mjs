// Raw control introducers that must not survive: 7-bit ESC (U+001B) and the

// the string introducers DCS/SOS/OSC/PM/APC (U+0090/0098/009D/009E/009F), and ST
// (U+009C). All are category Cc, so the invisible-char pass (which targets Cf /
// variation / blank fillers) never removes them; this residual sweep is the
// guarantee that none survives. Sweeping the whole C1 block — not just the
// introducers the ANSI grammar above names — fails closed: a DCS/SOS/PM/APC
// string the grammar does not consume still loses its introducer and terminator
// here, so no terminal can hide-render its body as a control payload.
// eslint-disable-next-line no-control-regex -- matching the raw introducers is the point
const CONTROL_INTRODUCER_RE = /[\u001b\u0080-\u009f]/g;

// An OSC (Operating System Command) string is `<introducer> … <terminator>`.
// Introducer: 7-bit `ESC]` or 8-bit C1 OSC (U+009D). Terminator: ST (`ESC\` or
// 8-bit C1 ST U+009C) OR the legacy BEL (U+0007). The body is everything up to
// the terminator — a title, a clickable-hyperlink URL, a clipboard write — i.e.
// attacker-controlled PAYLOAD TEXT. Matching the introducer alone (leaving the
// body) would let that payload survive into the model's view, so the OSC branch
// consumes the introducer, the whole body, AND the terminator as one unit.
//
// Three alternatives, tried in order:
//   1. a properly TERMINATED string — a body of bytes that no terminator can
//      start with (the negated class makes that run unambiguous and
//      backtrack-free), then a terminator (ST or BEL).
//   2. an ABORTED string — the body runs up to (but does NOT consume) an
//      interior bare ESC or a nested C1-OSC introducer (U+009D) that is not
//      itself part of a valid terminator. Per ECMA-48/xterm, a bare ESC (one
//      not immediately followed by `\` to form ST) aborts the OSC string in
//      progress — the terminal drops back to processing that ESC as the start
//      of a NEW sequence, and everything after it is normal text/escapes, not
//      part of this OSC's payload. Consuming only up to the lookahead (not
//      the ESC/U+009D itself) leaves it for the next position in this same
//      `.replace(ANSI_RE, ...)` scan to match as its own sequence (or, if it
//      doesn't complete one, for the residual C1 sweep in applyLayer1 to
//      remove just that one introducer byte) — so an interior ESC can no
//      longer delete the rest of the document (it used to fall through to
//      alternative 3 below and consume everything to EOS).
//   3. anything else from the introducer to END-OF-STRING (`[\s\S]*$`) — the
//      fail-closed catch-all for a GENUINELY unterminated string: no ST, BEL,
//      interior ESC, or nested OSC intro anywhere in the remainder, so there
//      is truly nothing left to hand to a later position. Reached only when
//      alternatives 1 and 2 both fail to find their respective triggers.
// All three are linear (bounded lookahead / no nested quantifiers), so the
// branch stays linear.

// CSI / two-byte ESC sequences (cursor moves, erase, SGR color, charset/DEC
// selectors): an introducer, a bounded private-intro run, optional numeric
// params, and a single final byte. Not an enforcement boundary on its own — any
// introducer this declines to match is still removed by the residual sweep in
// applyLayer1 — but matching the whole sequence keeps the common case one clean
// deletion (and avoids a lone-ESC residual on every styled line).
//
// The private-intro class is BOUNDED ({0,12}, not *) on purpose: ; and # live
// in both this class and the parameter group that follows, so an unbounded *
// here lets a ;#;#... run be split between the two quantifiers — O(n^2)
// backtracking on an ESC;#;#... string that never completes a sequence
// (CodeQL js/polynomial-redos). A constant bound makes the intro a constant
// factor, so the whole match is linear; a real sequence never carries more than
// a couple of intro bytes.
//
// Params allow BOTH `;` (standard parameter separator) and `:` (ITU T.416
// colon-separated SGR sub-parameters, e.g. truecolor `ESC[38:2:255:0:0m` as
// emitted by tmux/kitty/mintty) — legitimate, display-only ANSI that must not
// leave a colon-parameter residue behind.
//
// The final-byte class deliberately excludes `\d`: per ECMA-48, CSI final
// bytes occupy 0x40–0x7E (letters and a handful of punctuation) while digits
// are PARAMETER bytes and can never terminate a sequence — an unterminated
// `ESC[` therefore must not be allowed to eat trailing visible digits (e.g.
// `ESC[2024 report` is NOT `ESC[` + final-byte `2` + literal `024 report`; it
// is an incomplete CSI intro that the residual sweep in applyLayer1 cleans up,
// leaving "2024 report" intact). `=`, `<`, `>` are excluded for the same
// reason: 0x3C–0x3F (`<=>?`) are private PARAMETER-prefix bytes, not final
// bytes, per ECMA-48 § 5.4 — `?` already lives in the private-intro class
// above; `<=>` were never valid finals and including them let a private-marker
// sequence terminate one byte too early. `~` (0x7E) IS a real final byte (vt220
// function-key sequences, e.g. `ESC[3~` for Delete) and is kept.
